	abstract = {The revision of the Stress and Coping Inventory ({SCI}) uses a total of seven scales and 45 items to measure psychological stress, stress symptoms and stress management strategies. Reliability: The internal consistency lies between Cronbach's alpha = .75 and alpha = .87. Validity: The factorial validity was confirmed by factor analysis. The scale intercorrelation was examined. Similar scales show high correlation and dissimilar negative correlations (e.g. stress load/positive thinking: r = -.37). Special groups such as job seekers, alcohol and addiction abusers (e.g. drugs or gambling) show higher stress levels. Stressed students also exhibited maladaptive coping strategies more frequently.},
